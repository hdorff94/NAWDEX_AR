# Synthetic_Airborne_Arctic_ARs

This is the GIT repository used to investigate the divergence of moisture transport in nine exemplaric Atmospheric River (AR) cases using ERA5 and CARRA. By that, we want to assess the feasibility of deriving moisture transport divergence from sporadic airborne soundings. At the current state, this is done using synthetic sondes that are created within the reanalysis grid datasets for synthetically created zig-zag flight pattern.
